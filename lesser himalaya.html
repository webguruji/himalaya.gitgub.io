	The Himachal Range (Nepali: महाभारत पर्वत शृङ्खला mahāvārat parbat shrinkhalā) – also called the Lower Himalayan Range or Lesser Himalaya – is a major east-west mountain range with elevations 3,700 to 4,500 m (12,000 to 14,500 feet)  along the crest, paralleling the much higher High Himalayas range from the Indus River in Pakistan across northern India, Nepal, Sikkim and Bhutan but then the two ranges become increasingly difficult to differentiate east of Bhutan as the ranges approach the Brahmaputra River. The Himachal range also parallels the lower Shiwalik or Churia Range (Outer Himalaya) to the south. The Pir Panjal is the largest range of the Lesser Himalayas.
	 The rivers have a high-water period in the summer, caused by monsoon rains and the melting of mountain snow. The slopes are covered with forests at altitudes up to 3,500 m; there are monsoon forests and hard-leaved evergreen and coniferous forests in the west and evergreen tropical rain forests giving way with greater elevations to evergreen oak forests, coniferous and broadleaf forests, and coniferous forests in the east. Above this are thickets of scrub junipers and rhododendrons, subalpine meadows, and alpine meadows. Plantations of citrus fruits and tea grow at elevations up to 2,500m.

		The Lesser Himalayas extend for some 1,550 miles (2,500 km) northwest-southeast across the northern limit of the Indian subcontinent. Areas include the disputed Kashmir region (Gilgit-Baltistan, administered by Pakistan, and Jammu and Kashmir state, administered by India), the Indian states of Himachal Pradesh and Uttarakhand, Nepal, the Indian state of Sikkim, and Bhutan. The range lies between the Great Himalayas to the northeast and the Siwalik Range (Outer Himalayas) to the southeast and has an average elevation of 12,000 to 15,000 feet (3,700 to 4,500 metres). It includes portions of the western (Punjab), Kumaun, Nepal, and Assam Himalayas ranges.
