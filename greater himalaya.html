Also known as Inner Himalaya, Central Himalaya or Himadri.
Average elevation of 6,100 m above sea level and an average width of about 25 km.
It is mainly formed of the central crystallines (granites and gneisses) overlain by metamorphosed sediments [limestone]. {Rock System}
The folds in this range are asymmetrical with steep south slope and gentle north slope giving ‘hog back (a long, steep hill or mountain ridge)’ topography.
This mountain arc convexes to the south just like the other two.
Terminates abruptly at the syntaxial bends. One in the Nanga Parbat in north-west and the other in the Namcha Barwa in the north-east.
This mountain range boasts of the tallest peaks of the world, most of which remain under perpetual snow.
